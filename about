    <!-- Add your about me content here -->
    <p>Hi there! My name is Sihle Mtshini, and I'm a passionate web developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>
        <p>I discovered my love for coding during my university days, where I majored in Computer Science. Since then, I've been on an exciting journey of continuous learning and growth in the field of web development.</p>
        <p>I specialize in creating dynamic and user-friendly websites and web applications using a variety of technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like React and Vue.js. I'm also proficient in backend development with Node.js and Express.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new coffee shops around the city, playing guitar, or hiking in the beautiful countryside.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences that make a positive impact on people's lives. Whether it's building a sleek e-commerce platform or a robust web application, I'm always up for the challenge!</p>
